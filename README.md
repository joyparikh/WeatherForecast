# WeatherForecast Website
This website was developed using C# and .NET for backend and js and HTML for frontend.
The project follows the typical MVC(Models, Views, Controllers) architecture.

Weather data was fetched from https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/

### Some Features of the app:
1. Gives detailed current weather info and 14 days forecast
2. Minimalistic yet effective and easy to use design
3. Adaptive background color for current weather condition
4. Update time is generated by API in localtime, I provide the reference for relative time based on GMT conversion allowing user to use app anywhere
